# LearnedRubiks
Learned Rubiks will be a application that solves a rubiks cube in some regaurd. 
Currently it will vizualize a rubiks cube and listen to gestures to perform full cube rotations. 
A future project will contain a fully functioning virtual Rubik's Cube.


## Cube Definition Virtually (RubiksCube.swift)
This class(es) will be what we use to analyze the state of the cube and perform turns. 
The RubiksCube class has a list of Cublets that each have the following properties:
* node:SCNNode - the node that is in the SCNScene 
* pos - a position that repersents where the cublet is on the cube see [cuble position](###-Cublet-Position)

## Index
### Cublet Position
Each layer follow the same order and the pieces are numbered in the following manner:
* Down Right Front Corner: 1
* Down Right Wedge: 2
* Down Right Back Corner: 3
* Down Front Wedge: 4
* Down Center: 5
* Down Back Wedge: 6
* Down Front Left Corner: 7
* Down Left Wedge: 8
* Down Left Back Corner: 9

So for example the Front Up piece is 22. **There is a middle piece that will never be seen that is number 14**
